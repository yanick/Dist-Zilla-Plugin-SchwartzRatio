package Dist::Zilla::Plugin::SchwartzRatio;
# ABSTRACT: display the Schwartz ratio of the distribution upon release

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In dist.ini:

    [SchwartzRatio]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Schwartz Ratio of CPAN is the number of latest
releases over the total number of releases that CPAN has. For
a single distribution, it boils down to the less exciting
number of previous releases still on CPAN.

After a successful release, the plugin displays
the releases of the distribution still kicking around on CPAN,
just to give an idea to the author that maybe it's time
to do some cleanup.
